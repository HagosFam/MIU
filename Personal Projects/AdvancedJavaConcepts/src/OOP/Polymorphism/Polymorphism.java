                    // is when a sub class provides its own implementation of a method which is defined in super class
                // interface
                    // many classes can implement a method provided by an interface and gives different implementaions
                // abstract classes
                    // are classes that cannot be instanitiated
                    // classes can inherit from abstract class and implement it its own method, polymorphism
                // Generics
                    // Generics allow for the creation of classes, interfaces and methods that can work with different
                    // types of objects. This promotes polymorphic behavior because same method can be used with d/t
                    // types of objects.
                    // Polymorphism and inheritance promotes program for change, welcomes extension.
